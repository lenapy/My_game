# My_game - Millionaire
Rules:
All Contestants will be asked up to 12 questions of varying degrees of difficulty,
as determined in the sole discretion of the Producer.
Contestants must choose the most correct answer choice of the four (4)
possible answer choices provided. Each question has an assigned
hryvnias value that increases in amount from One thousand hryvnias (1000)
to One Million Hryvnias (1,000,000). A Contestant may end his/her Game
at any time prior to locking in a “final answer” for the current
question and walk away with the winnings already earned.
If a Contestant answers all 12 questions correctly, he/she wins
One Million Hryvnias (1,000,000). If a Contestant answers a question
incorrectly, he/she will be eliminated from the Game and will win the
amount of the last “Safety Net”  reached, which may represent a loss
in some of the winnings earned to that point.
During the Game, the Contestant will face up to 12 questions,
and may be able to take one (or more) of four actions:
(a) answer the question; (b) use the “Fifty-Fifty”
lifeline; (c) use the “Ask the Audience”; (d) “Call to friend”, lifeline;
or (e) walk away.
